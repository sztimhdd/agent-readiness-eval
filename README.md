# Agent Readiness Eval v3

`agent-readiness-eval` is a portable question-pack Skill. It issues tasks and defines the answer format. It does not execute, grade, sanitize, package, or certify results.

The design follows the useful split from SecPriv Skill, Harbor, Terminal-Bench, and Meta-Harness:

- Skill content is portable.
- Harness execution remains native.
- Dataset/task, harness, model, and scoring are separate variables.
- Offline reviewers score answer artifacts after the run.

## How to Run

Install this Skill in a compatible harness. Send one message:

```text
评测
```

The harness should read `tasks/task-<N>/`, solve it using its own native tools, and write an answer directory under `runs/`.

For a leakage-free, repeatable Codex installation and comparison procedure, see
[`docs/INSTALL-CODEX.md`](docs/INSTALL-CODEX.md).

## Task Catalog

| Task | Domain | Difficulty | Key Capability |
|------|--------|------------|----------------|
| 001 — Customer Ticket Triage | Financial Services | Basic | Single-source info extraction, risk sorting |
| 002 — AI Platform Incident Investigation | Technical Operations | Intermediate | Multi-file correlation, confidence estimation |
| 003 — Policy Compliance Check | Enterprise Compliance | Intermediate | Conditional reasoning, edge case handling |
| 004 — Cross-System Data Reconciliation | Finance / Operations | Advanced | Heterogeneous source alignment, discrepancy detection |
| 005 — Conflicting Requirements Resolution | Project Management | Intermediate | Ambiguity resolution, constraint-based decision making |
| 006 — Multi-Source Report Synthesis | Business Intelligence | Advanced | Multi-source synthesis, critical data evaluation |

## Answer Directory

```

Use `UNAVAILABLE` for metadata the harness cannot observe. Do not estimate token usage.

## What This Package Does Not Include

This package has no packaged execution engine, grading engine, child-agent control layer, result packaging pipeline, privacy scrubber, integrity manifest, or answer key.

Those concerns belong to each harness or to a separate offline review layer.
